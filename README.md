# ACKNOWLEGEMENTS 
This project has inspired me based on my real website on Big Cartel, which is my own personal business website. While I initially used a template for that site, this project gives me the opportunity to code everything from scratch. It's focused on a very minimalist and white and pink sleek and chic aesthetic.
